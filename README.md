# Time Series Decomposition - bike sales in a American store

## This notebook explore classic time series decomposition techiniques to understand sales patterns in a bike store.
  
The decomposition principle is based on separating the basic three fundamental parts of some kinds of time series data: 
Trend-cycle, Seasonality, and Random error. According to this definition, randomness is part of the series. However, some definitions might 
state that the series is formed just by Trend-cycle and Seasonality, with the error component being something aside from the data.
